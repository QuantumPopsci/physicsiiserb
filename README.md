# A HitcHhiker's Guide to Physics @ IISERB
Hey everyone! 👋 Check out this new website I've been working on, made just for us:

A Hitchhiker's Guide to Physics - IISERB

It's a one-stop hub for everything related to the physics department, designed to make our lives easier and more connected especially in the early years as a Physics Major.

Here’s a quick look at all the features packed into it:

📚 Course Guides
A complete list of all physics courses with their detailed syllabus, recommended textbooks (with links!), and other important info.

🗓️ Interactive Timetable
The full, color-coded semester schedule in a clean grid format. It clearly shows all classes, labs, etc.

🔬 Research in Physics
A beautiful page that explores active research fields like Quantum Computing, Astrophysics, and more, complete with descriptions, video introductions, and links to key papers and labs.

📂 Shared Resources Hub
This is our own collaborative platform! You can upload your notes and other useful files for everyone to use. It's a moderated system, so you can also post requests for specific documents you're looking for.

🔗 Links & Videos
A curated collection of interesting external resources, like must-read papers and fascinating physics videos from around the web.

🤝 Contacts Page
A directory of current students and alumni, making it easy to connect with people in different fields for advice and networking.

💬 Physics Discussion Forum
An exclusive, real-time chat forum only for users with an @iiserb.ac.in email. It's a moderated space to ask doubts, discuss topics, and collaborate anonymously and safely.
